# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Machine Learning Mini-project

First of all, we need to understand what is the meaning of churn

Churn is defined in business terms as ‘when a client cancels a subscription to a service they have been using.’

A common example is people cancelling Spotify/Netflix subscriptions. 

So, Churn Prediction is essentially predicting which clients are most likely to cancel a subscription i.e ‘leave a company’ based on their usage of the service.

The output in the case of Churn prediction is a simple yes or a no. That makes it a classification problem.
